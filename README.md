# Project React Native App ðŸ“±


Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
This is my first App: A pedometer which renders differently according to the number of steps taken. Above 1000 steps, an Afirmation API is fetched, above 5000 steps, an encourgaing statement is rendered and above 10000 steps, the user is congratulated for reaching their goal

## The problem

I started this project by checking the react-native documentation to work out how to implement the pedometer settings. I then coded to fetch the API - Initially with a button, but this was then removed- and then the two functions were merged together. I have successfully managed to conditionaly render both the background images and messages, depending on the steps the user has taken. 

Technology: React, React-native, styled-components
